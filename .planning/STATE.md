## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Folder basename as primary project name strategy (pending validation)
- [Init]: Replace polling with SSE — Phase 2 prerequisite for all UI work
- [Init]: Vite vanilla-ts frontend extracted from embedded HTML in Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Hooks confirmed to silently fail in subdirectories (GitHub #10367, #8810). Fix strategy: use global ~/.claude/settings.json and prefix paths with $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR.
- [Pre-Phase 1]: AskUserQuestion must use PermissionRequest hook, NOT PostToolUse (GitHub #15872).
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Stop hook fires for sub-agents — debounce needed server-side (10s cooldown per project).
- [Pre-Phase 3]: web-push@3.6.7 maintenance status uncertain — validate push works before building UI that depends on it.
